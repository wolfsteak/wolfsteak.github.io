Gửi Snob,

Tôi đang tìm mua một chiếc đồng hồ cơ trong tầm giá $20,000. Danh sách rút gọn chỉ còn 2 chiếc: Nomos Lambda và Rolex Cellini Time

Chiếc đồng hồ duy nhất trong bộ sưu tập của tôi là một chiếc Grand Seiko. Anh giúp tôi quyết định nhé?

Còn nữa, với tầm giá này tôi có nên cân nhắc một chiếc Lange hay Patek không, vì đằng nào tôi cũng sẽ mua thêm đồng hồ trong 3 năm tới.


Well, first of all you are to be congratulated on your very good taste; you’ve narrowed your choices in what seems to me a very intelligent fashion, and the fact that the base of your collection is a Grand Seiko speaks to your ability to both trust your own judgement, and formulate sensible views on watches.
Anh có con mắt được đấy. Qua danh sách rút gọn đó tôi biết anh 
With that said, however, for the price, I think you would be far better off with a Saxonia wristwatch from A. Lange & Söhne. The NOMOS is not a bad watch but it is, at least for now, a bit of a novelty from a company better known for offering good value than for consistently producing the highest quality execution; the Rolex Cellini is also not a bad watch, but it hardly represents the most compelling proposition from The Crown. And Patek nowadays is a bit too much a victim of its own success; it is too obvious a choice. The Lange, on the other hand, is not only qualitatively unimpeachable, it has a certain obstinate, going-our-own-way character that I appreciate, as one stubborn contrarian deserves another. 

Best Value Watch
My husband will be 50 shortly and I am turning to you for guidance on a watch. I readily admit that this has been more challenging than I initially expected! A brief history: on a trip to Berlin I noticed my husband showed a new enthusiasm for watches, but at that time he decided not to get anything until he learned more on a brand that peaked his interest. A few months later he bought a watch from a different German brand (Archimede pilot chronograph) and, as he explained it to me, he chose a watch with an inexpensive Valjoux movement. He was not prepared to spend thousands of dollars without justification. I wish to surprise him with a serious watch since I know he likes chronographs. I thought of an Omega at first, but after a bit of research, much influenced by your views, I have narrowed to these three chronographs: the JLC master, Glashutte Original Senator or Zenith el Primero. Any guidance to choose among these or to consider another will be greatly welcomed indeed.
It seems to me that here we must deduce from the evidence available that your husband would prefer something solid, of enduring interest and value, that not only does not come too dear but that actually represents the best possible value. At the risk of arousing howls of invective from readers of mine who have nothing better to do than complain when I give good advice, I am going to repeat what I have often said: at this price range, and in this category, there is the Omega Speedmaster Professional, and there is everything else.

The Moonwatch is still affordable (I don’t have to fret over such things but I’ve long since made my peace with the fact that not everyone’s great-grandparents were lucky enough to have made a killing on laudanum and cocaine fortified “Tonics For The Housewife” in the ‘20s) — it is still an attractive design, it is still extremely reliable, and it is uncontaminated with modern pseudo-advances like silicon. I, even I, the Watch Snob, count a Speedmaster amongst the trinkets littering my sock drawer. Go thou, and do likewise.
